                        <li>One of the most exciting aspects of the 2026 World Cup is the opportunity for fans to travel to North America and experience the tournament in person.</li>
                        <li>With matches being held in cities all over the three host countries, fans will have the chance to explore new places, meet new people, and soak up the incredible atmosphere of the World Cup.</li>

            <h1 class="info__title">Who I think will win the FIFA World Cup in 2026</h1>   
            <p>  There are many teams could be considered as strong contenders for the 2026 World Cup based on current standings and recent results. They include emerging teams like Argentina, Germany, and Brazil together with well-established groups like Belgium and France. The teams' performance on the field and how they respond to problems they encounter in the remaining rounds will determine how the tournament turns out. I predict that the 2026 World Cup will include some of the most exciting and captivating football the globe has ever witnessed. Based on the most recent me, France should become as the favorite to win the 2026 World Cup.</p>

            <ul>
                <strong>1. France </strong> 
            </ul>
                <p>Is anyone going to be amazed by France's chance of winning the 2026 World Cup? Despite the absence of players like Karim Benzema, Paul Pogba, and N'Golo Kante, among others, the nation came unbelievably close to winning a second straight championship in 2022. France is blessed with talent, even if several top players wont be part of the next World Cup.</p>
            <ul>
                <strong>2. Brail</strong> 
            </ul>
                <p>Brazil was highly expected to win the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, but the team lost their quarterfinal match against Croatia because of so many wasted chances. The team's forwards are mostly still young, therefore the lack of experience was a concern. </p>
            <ul> 
                <strong>3. England</strong> 
            </ul>
                <p>England's performances in the previous three major competitions have left me unsure. They all ended the same way: the squad never played an active role in unexpected results. England was in the favor for every game they should have won but fell short every time the opposing squad was favored. The good news is that many English players should be significantly stronger by the next World Cup. The highest levels of experience are already accomplished by many young ballers.   England could easily be the most talented team in the next World Cup.</p>
